# Entrolibrium

Defining and computing Entropy Optimal Strategies (EOS) in games.

## Origins

A benign test of new Gemini version turned into insights that are novel
and (barely) coherent enough to warrant a publication.

## Status

I wanted to upload to arXiv, but I do not see a category specific to game theory,
and I do not have an endorsement for any math category anyway
(and entrolibrium is not theoretical physics).

For now, I am "publishing" in github, using open but otherwise restrictive licenses.
